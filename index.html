    <h1>Kaun Banega Carorpati</h1>
    <p>Kaun Banega Crorepati (also simply known as KBC) is an Indian Hindi-language television game show. It is the
        official Hindi adaptation of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise. It has been presented by actor
        Amitabh Bachchan since its inception, except for during the third season, which was presented by actor Shah Rukh
        Khan.[2] The programme aired on Star Plus for its first three seasons from 2000 to 2007, and was commissioned by
        the programming team of Sameer Nair.[3][4] Since 2010, it has been airing on Sony Entertainment Television and
        was produced by BIG Synergy (under various names over periods of time) from season 1 till season 10. Afterwards,
        the credited production companies co-producing are Studio NEXT since season 10[a] and Tree of Knowledge (Digi
        TOK) since season 11,[b] respectively.

        The format is similar to other shows in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? franchise: contestants are asked
        multiple choice questions and must select the correct answer from four possible choices, and are provided with
        lifelines that may be used if they are uncertain. Since season 7 in 2013, the top prize has been â‚¹7 crore
        (70,000,000 rupees).</p>
